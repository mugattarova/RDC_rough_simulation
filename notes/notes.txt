- when the simulation is supposed to fade to background, it doesn't 
- strange green pattern instead
- background changes colour

1. tried to provide no stimulus
    background still changes colour? some change by default? cringe
    u value appears to deteriorate over time
    so the calculation needs to be deterministic

    1.1 round to 6 sig figs
        after at most 25 iterations it platoes (more or less)
            0.002167
        after at most 100 iterations changes
            0.002166
        after at most 200 iterations
            0.002165
        the pattern continues, although it takes more iterations for the number to change

- i need to provide limits (with an input image?)

- i think i know where the issue lies. I provide the same illumination everywhere, when i maybe shouldn't?
- i broke it - it doesn't spread after the first propagation :(
- picture input works though

- spreads instatly?? 255 off the bat
- 130 off the bat. internal elements seems to be intact?? must be the visualiser?
- picture was being multiplied by 255 twice. stupid

- now the reaction cuts off too fast, this is especially evident with random noise - it cancels out into blackness, instead of reaching equilibrium

- waves need to travel farther (or actually make vesicles smaller)
- decreased phi, waves travel for longer. increasing screen size again to 100x150
